# svelte-preprocessing

An old experimental personal website of mine, where a custom markdown preprocessor was plugged in. So you could write something like:

```html
<template lang=1>

# Header

*italics*

</template>

<CustomSvelteComponent />
```

An article describing how to achieve this with svelte is included

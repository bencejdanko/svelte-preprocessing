I love the Hobbit movies. I watched them all upon release, the first being on 2012 when I was 10. I read the book multiple times, but never hung myself on the inconsistencies; The atmosphere and mood was nothing like I had seen before.

At the time is was this excitement for the Tolkien universe that made Angband palatable. I could spend 4 to 5 hours playing in a session, spending equal time drawing up backgrounds and concept art. I conjured up my own primitive Silmarillion, still read my little Hobbit book over and over.

My enjoyment for roguelikes was recently reignited by |Harmonist@https://harmonist.tuxfamily.org/|, built using a cross-application tile library. It's a wonderful puzzle-based take on roguelikes, where the player-item relationship is very similar to Breath of the Wild; a combination of indurable, yet abundant items that force you into unique experiences and decision making. But it doesn't scratch that same itch for a bottomless pit, of endless creatures, artifacts and lore. 

But I never really want to enter that same stretch of addiction. I want more from Angband now; I want to understand how it works,

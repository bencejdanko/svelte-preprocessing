    "term": "Finite-state machine",
    "definition": "A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition.[1] An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. Finite-state machines are of two typesâ€”deterministic finite-state machines and non-deterministic finite-state machines.[2] For any non-deterministic finite-state machine, an equivalent deterministic one can be constructed."
